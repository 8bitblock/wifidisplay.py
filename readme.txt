# ORIGINAL FILE MADE BY V0rT3x #
## this is a remake of the original file by V0rT3x I have used chat gpt to assist with some coding, if its not working on your display check the line: ##
 def get_position(self, ui):
        if ui.is_waveshare_v4():
            return (0, 95) if self.options["orientation"] == "horizontal" else (180, 61) 
line and change the v4 to whatever version your display is, if you have another display im not 100% sure how to help
have fun and happy pwning
